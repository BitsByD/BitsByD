- 👋 Hi, I’m @BitsByD
- 👀 I’m interested in geospatial things, high performing teams, and preparing for cooking (_mise en place_ - the cooking part is hit or miss).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about how GitHub builds and ships software.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smoothing out bumps in the planning, building, and shipping of enterprise products.
- 📫 [@dvhthomas](https://twitter.com/dvhthomas) on Twitter, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-thomas/), and my personal blog at [Bits By Me](https://bitsby.me).
