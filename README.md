* 👋 Hi, I’m @BitsByD
* 👀 I’m interested in geospatial things, high performing teams, and preparing for cooking (_mise en place_ - the cooking part is hit or miss).
* 🌱 I’m currently learning all about how GitHub builds and ships software.
* 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smoothing out bumps in the planning, building, and shipping of enterprise products.
